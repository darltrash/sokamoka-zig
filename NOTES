The engine only adds static elements with a collider box as collidable

The engine has a hard limit on how much entities can be added to a single level,
    but it shouldnt be a big deal

The Sokol-Zig wrapper is very very very nice, and sokol itself is very well designed

If I could start over, i'd have a clear definition of what does what and how

Ligma bolas :)

The engine (and buildmap.lua) does NOT support the entire ldtk format by design

sokamoka must be about a fox with socks which drinks mokaccinos, no matter what

ソカモカ

The atlas is hardcoded in, and the map defines the way the atlas is applied to tiles
    (which is done as an exchange of processing power by ram usage)

Try to pre-optimize as much as you can

The maps' precalculated tile vertices are EXTREMELY UNEFFICIENT, I should implement
greedy meshing :/
